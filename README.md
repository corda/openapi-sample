# Corda_OpenAPI sample using project Braid

## Introduction
Project Braid .....
.....
.....

## Tools you need
- Maven : https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp%3A%2F%2Fapache.cs.utah.edu%2Fapache.org%2F
- IntelliJ : https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac
- Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/download/








## Step1: Downloads and setting up bootstrap Corda network
### Download project Braid 
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/bluebank/braid.git
```

### Download openapi-generator. 
Find more details at: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator
For mac/linux user:
```
brew install openapi-generator
```
or for windows user:
```
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
```
### Download and Start the Cordapp. 
For this Demo, we are using our bootcamp Cordapp. Links:https://github.com/peterli-r3/bootcamp-openapi
Commands to build & start your nodes:
```
git clone git@github.com:peterli-r3/bootcamp-openapi.git
cd bootcamp-cordapp
./gradlew deployNodes
./build/nodes/runnodes
```
If you need more information on running the Cordapp, please visit our docs at: https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html

Right now, you should have 4 nodes running in your terminal including PartyA, PartyB, PartyC and Notary. 
Go to the PartyA's node crash shell, you will see the the RPC connection address:
```
Advertised P2P messaging addresses      : localhost:10003
RPC connection address                  : localhost:10004
RPC admin connection address            : localhost:10005
```

## Srep 2: Build and Start Braid Server 
⚠️Before you build your braid proejct, if you dont have any docker tools installed in your machine, you need to comment out line#303 to line#326 in the `/braid/braid-server/pom.xml` because this part of the code is trying to build a docker image. 

Now, move to the Braid project directory and run:(Just to skip the tests for faster build)
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
In IntelliJ, focate to `braid/braid-server/src/main/kotlin/io/bluebank/braid/server/BraidMain.kt` and run Configuration as it is.(which will fail for the first time, and ask for some parameters). 

Now, find the down triangle to open up the run configuration. 
At the Program arguments, paste in: `localhost:10004 user1 test 10200 3 "/YOUR-PATH-TO-THIS-FOLDER/bootcamp-cordapp/build/nodes/PartyA/cordapps"`
- RPC connection address:   localhost:10004
- node login username:      user1           
- node login password:      test  
- Your desired expose port: 10200
- openapi version:          3
- Cordapp folder to pick up the jar:       "YOUR-PATH-TO-THIS-FOLDER/bootcamp-cordapp/build/nodes/PartyA/cordapps" 

Now run the function again. You should have Braid Server running on http://localhost:10200/. And you should see the following in you IntelliJ's console:
```
io.bluebank.braid.corda.rest.RestMounter - swagger json bound to http://localhost:10009/swagger.json
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.rest.RestMounter - Swagger UI bound to http://localhost:10009/
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.server.BraidCordaStandaloneServer - registering: /cordapps/bootcamp-cordapp/flows/bootcamp.TokenIssueFlowInitiator
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.rest.RestMounter - REST end point bound to http://localhost:10009/api/rest
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.BraidVerticle - BraidVerticle.setupRouter complete -- 2775 msec
io.bluebank.braid.corda.BraidVerticle - BraidVerticle.setupWebserver complete -- 5177 msec
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.BraidVerticle - Braid server started on
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.BraidVerticle - Braid service mounted on http://localhost:10009/api/
INFO  io.bluebank.braid.corda.BraidServer - Braid server started successfully on 10009
```

## Step 3: To continue the example, you have two options. 
- Option 1: Use pre-implmented API Libary, and run the react front-end.
- Option 2: Use openapi generator to generate an API library yourself.

### Opt1: Use pre-generated API Libary, and run the react front-end.
Download the React front-end at https://github.com/peterli-r3/react_openapi
```
git clone https://github.com/peterli-r3/react_openapi.git
cd react_openapi
npm install
```
At the `src/code-gen/io.generated.api` folder, it sits the pre-generated APIs.
Now, start the react webapp by running:
```
npm start
```
The app should be running localhost:3000

### Opt2: Generate JS API Library using openapi-generator yourself
Generate your own version of API library, by running in terminal: 
```
openapi-generator generate -i http://localhost:10200/swagger.json -g javascript -o ./code-gen --api-package io.generated.api --model-package io.generated.model
```
- -i :The json file that is generated by Braid. (You can pick it up from IntelliJ's terminal)

- -g which languages do you want your API to be in, (Openapi support more than 30+ server languages)

- -o :where you are saving the API library

- --api-package io.generated.api --model-package io.generated.model: Renaming the package for better sighting. 

Now, drop this API library into your desired front-end directory, and now you can call the functions just as a normal API Library call!


If you are doing thr code-gen yourself, you need to change:
Line#62 in NetworkApi.js needs to be change from `'x500-name': opts['x500Name']` to `'x500-name': opts['x500-name']`
